        There are a few reasons why some people prefer sugaring to waxing for
        hair removal:
      </h3>
      <ul
        style={{
          margin: "20px",
          padding: "40px",
        }}
      >
        <li>
          Sugaring paste is made from natural ingredients, such as sugar, lemon
          juice, and water, which some people find to be gentler on the skin
          than wax.
        </li>

        <li>
          The sugaring process is less painful than waxing, as the paste is
          applied at a lower temperature and adheres to the hair rather than the
          skin.
        </li>

        <li>
          Sugaring paste can be easily washed off with water, whereas wax must
          be removed with an oil or lotion. This can make the cleanup process
          after sugaring easier and less messy.
        </li>

        <li>
          Sugaring may result in fewer ingrown hairs compared to waxing, as the
          paste removes hair in the natural direction of growth.
        </li>

        <li>
          Sugaring can be less expensive than waxing in the long run, as the
          paste can be used multiple times before it needs to be replaced.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
